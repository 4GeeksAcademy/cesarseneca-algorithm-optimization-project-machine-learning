The system has the ability to add books to the library, lend books to readers, and receive books back. In addition, it can also list all the books available in the library.\n","\n","The problem is that the system is very slow and needs to be optimized. Your task is to analyze the code, identify areas of improvement and rewrite parts of the code to make it more efficient. Specifically, you are asked to perform the following improvements (update the below code and implement the following points):\n","\n","1. Identify and improve the data structures used to store books in the library and borrowed books. *Hint: Use an `set` instead of a `list` to store books in `Library.books` and `Library.borrowed_books` to make it more efficient to check if a book is present.**\n","\n","2. Avoid errors that could occur when attempting to borrow or return a book that is not present. *Hint: Use the `set.discard()` method instead of `list.remove()` in `Library.borrow_book()` and `Library.return_book()` to avoid errors if the book is not present.*\n","\n","3. Improve the efficiency of selecting a random book to lend or return. *Hint: Instead of selecting a random book from `Library.books` or `Library.borrowed_books` by indexing (which involves a conversion to list which is expensive), you can convert these sets to lists only once before the cycle.*\n","\n","4. Improve the efficiency of the function that lists all the books available in the library. *Hint: Instead of printing each book one by one in `Library.list_books()`, you can construct a complete string with all book titles and then print that string once.*\n","\n","5. Avoid repeated calls to `len()` in the body of loops.\n","\n","6. Use list comprehension to improve efficiency of book creation.. *Hint: Use list comprehension for book creation, which can be faster than using a for loop and repeatedly calling `Library.add_book()`.*\n","\n","7. Optimize checking the availability of borrowed books before attempting to return them. *Hint: Avoid checking `if library.borrowed_books:` before attempting to return a book.
